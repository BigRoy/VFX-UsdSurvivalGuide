# Composition (Combining layers)
Composition is the "art" of combining layers in USD.

Composition requires some base knowledge that we cover in our fundamentals section. You can also skip it, as it is a bit of a deep dive, but we highly recommend it, as the subsequent pages refer to it quite often.

- [Composition Fundamentals](./fundamentals.md): Here we cover the basic terminology and principles behind composition.
- [Composition Arcs](./arcs.md): Here we look at how to create composition arcs via code.
- [Composition Strength Ordering (LIVRPS)](./livrps.md): Here we discuss each arc's usage and give tips and tricks on how to best utilize it in production.
- [List Editable Ops](./listeditableops.md): Here we look at list editable ops. These are used to give every arc a specific load order. We also take a look at other aspects of USD that use these.
- [Inspecting Composition (Prim Cache Population (PCP))](./pcp.md): Here we take a look at how to debug and inspect composition.
