# Elements
In this sub-section we have a look at the basic building blocks of Usd.

Our approach is incrementally going from the smallest building blocks to the larger ones (except for metadata), so recommended order to work through is as follows:

- [Paths](./path.md)
- [Data Containers (Prims & Properties)](./data_container.md)
    - [Prims](./prim.md)
    - [Properties (Attributes/Relationships)](./property.md)
- [Data Types](./data_type.md)
- [Schemas ('Classes' in OOP terminology)](./schemas.md)
- [Metadata](./metadata.md)
- [Layers & Stages (Containers of actual data)](./layer.md)
- [Loading Data (Purpose/Visibility/Activation/Population)](./loading_mechanisms.md)
- [Animation/Time Varying Data](./animation.md)
- [Transforms](./transform.md)
- [Notices/Event Listeners](./notice.md)
- [Standalone Utilities](./standalone_utilities.md)

This will introduce you to the core classes you be using the most and then increasing the complexity step by step to see how they work together with the rest of the API.
