# Schemas
This page only covers how to create custom schemas, as we cover what schemas are in our [schemas](../elements/schemas.md) basic building blocks of USD section.

As there is a very well written documentation in the [official docs](https://openusd.org/release/api/_usd__page__generating_schemas.html), we only cover compilation/installation here as a hands-on example and won't go into any customization details.
